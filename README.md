# exponentiation
Create a C++ int that you can do `number ** number` on.\
Use eint.cpp to create `eint`s to do `int` operations _and_ exponentiation.
1. Clone or download the respository.
2. Copy eint.cpp into your directory.
3. In your source code, type `#include "eint.cpp"` and use the `ExpMath::eint` type as you like.
